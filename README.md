## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- ADA
- JavaScript
- Bootstrap
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library


### What I learned

This was my first time completed a challenge in react. The switch from using the DOM to using state streamlined the process. Using a /utils folder made the code even cleaner. I learned how to pass information from one component to another through state managment of "parent" and "child" componenet and how simple statements can achive powerful results. Antoher main focus of this challenge was to maintain inclusively by abiding with accessibility requirements. I enjoyed the learning and practice.

### Continued development

In the future I would like to maintain this attention to accessibility with my web applications. Separating logic into smaller singular functions that are easier to maintain is a pillar of the type of software I'd like to create, moving forward I'd like to continue to showcase and grow that skill.
